Search-Engine
A Search Engine created from scratch that can search over a 4GB corpus made up of webpages from UCI.

This search engine can currently index a given corpus. In this case we used UCI webpages.
Once indexed, the user can give the search engine a query and the search engine will return the most relevant results.
The current code runs well on a small corpus but it was also written with the ability to be expanded to support a much larger corpus as well if needed.
